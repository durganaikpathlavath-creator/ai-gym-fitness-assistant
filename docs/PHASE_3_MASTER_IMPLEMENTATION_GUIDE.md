## PHASE 3 MASTER IMPLEMENTATION & LEARNING GUIDE
### Pose-to-Performance Analyzer & Weekly Progress Intelligence

## 1. What Phase 3 Does & Why We Need It

### The Core Problem in Fitness Apps
In **Phase 2**, we built a real-time computer vision engine. A user stands in front of a camera, MediaPipe extracts 33 body landmarks, our state machine counts repetitions, biomechanical rules detect posture errors, and our scoring engine calculates a **Performance Score (0 to 100)** for that single workout session.

However, an athlete or lifter does not train in a vacuum. A single workout only answers:
> *"How did I perform right now, in this specific set?"*

It does **not** answer the most important questions in fitness:
1. *"Am I actually getting better over time, or is my technique degrading?"*
2. *"Which specific component of my movement improved the most this week?"*
3. *"Do I have a persistent bad habit (like shallow squats or forward torso lean) that keeps recurring across multiple days?"*
4. *"What single actionable focus should I take into the gym next week to fix my biggest weakness?"*

### The Phase 3 Solution
**Phase 3 — Pose-to-Performance Analyzer & Weekly Progress Intelligence** transforms raw, single-session computer vision logs into **actionable longitudinal fitness intelligence**. 

Instead of showing raw, disconnected numbers, Phase 3:
- Aggregates workouts over a rolling 7-day, 14-day, or 30-day window.
- Computes deterministic, mathematically grounded performance trends (**improving**, **declining**, or **stable**).
- Pinpoints the user's **Strongest Measurable Improvement Area** using component-level delta analysis with strict biomechanical tie-breaking.
- Detects the user's **Recurring Form Weakness** across dozens of reps with severity-based tie-breaking.
- Synthesizes a **Next-Week Coaching Focus** so the athlete knows exactly what cue to focus on during their next session.
- Delivers this intelligence through a secure REST API (`GET /performance/weekly`) and a rich Next.js 16 analytics dashboard (`/reports`) featuring custom SVG sparklines and severity-coded error distributions.

## 3. Database Schema & How Phase 2 Data Feeds Phase 3

No new database tables were needed for Phase 3. The architecture leverages the normalized relational foundation built in Phase 2.1 and Phase 2.5:

### 1. `workout_sessions` Table
Stores high-level session metadata:
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique session ID.
- `user_id` (Foreign Key -> `users.id`): Enforces tenant isolation.
- `started_at` (Timestamp): Used for chronological time-window filtering (`WHERE started_at >= now - timedelta(days)`).
- `performance_score` (Float): Overall session score (0.0 to 100.0) computed by the Phase 2.5 engine.

### 2. `workout_exercises` Table
Tracks exercise volume within a session:
- `workout_session_id` (Foreign Key -> `workout_sessions.id`).
- `exercise_id` (Foreign Key -> `exercises.id` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
- `sets` (Integer >= 0) and `reps` (Integer >= 0): Summed across the reporting period to compute total repetition volume.

### 3. `pose_metrics` Table
Contains granular per-repetition biomechanical telemetry:
- `workout_session_id` (Foreign Key -> `workout_sessions.id`).
- `rep_number` (Integer): Rep index within the session.
- `violations` (String): Comma-separated violation codes recorded during that rep (e.g., `"INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH,EXCESSIVE_TORSO_LEAN"`).
- `metrics_json` (JSON String): Stores fine-grained subcomponent scores:
  ```json
  {
    "rom_score": 92.5,
    "form_score": 88.0,
    "stability_score": 85.0,
    "smooth_score": 90.0,
    "tempo_score": 82.0,
    "completion_quality": 95.0,
    "symmetry_score": 89.0
  }
  ```

## 4. The Intelligence Engines & Mathematical Formulas

### A. Performance Trend Engine (Subdivision 3.2)

To evaluate whether a user is getting better or worse, we cannot simply take the first workout and compare it to the last workout (which would be sensitive to an anomalous bad or good day). Instead, we split the chronological session sequence into two halves:

1. Let $N$ be the number of completed sessions in the window:
   - If $N < 2$, there is not enough history:
     $$\text{Trend} = \text{"insufficient\_history"}, \quad \Delta_{\text{score}} = \text{None}$$
2. Divide the $N$ sessions into two temporal sets:
   - **Prior Half**: Sessions $1$ through $M$, where $M = \lfloor N / 2 \rfloor$.
   - **Recent Half**: Sessions $M + 1$ through $N$.
3. Compute the mean score for each half:
   $$\bar{S}_{\text{prior}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} S_i$$
   $$\bar{S}_{\text{recent}} = \frac{1}{N - M} \sum_{j=M+1}^{N} S_j$$
4. Compute the delta:
   $$\Delta_{\text{score}} = \text{round}(\bar{S}_{\text{recent}} - \bar{S}_{\text{prior}}, 1)$$
5. Classify the trend using deterministic thresholds ($\pm 2.5\text{ pts}$):
   - $\Delta_{\text{score}} \ge +2.5 \implies \mathbf{improving}$
   - $\Delta_{\text{score}} \le -2.5 \implies \mathbf{declining}$
   - $-2.5 < \Delta_{\text{score}} < +2.5 \implies \mathbf{stable}$

#### Simple Numerical Example:
Suppose an athlete logged 4 workouts this week:
- Tuesday: Score 70.0
- Thursday: Score 74.0
- Saturday: Score 85.0
- Sunday: Score 87.0

$N = 4, M = 2$.
- Prior Half: `[70.0, 74.0]` $\rightarrow \bar{S}_{\text{prior}} = \frac{70 + 74}{2} = 72.0$
- Recent Half: `[85.0, 87.0]` $\rightarrow \bar{S}_{\text{recent}} = \frac{85 + 87}{2} = 86.0$
- $\Delta_{\text{score}} = 86.0 - 72.0 = +14.0\text{ pts}$
- Since $+14.0 \ge +2.5$, the trend is deterministically classified as **`improving`**.

---

### B. Strongest Improvement Area & Priority Tie-Breaking (Subdivision 3.3)

We compare the average subcomponent scores between the Prior Half and the Recent Half for all components stored in `metrics_json`:
$$\Delta_c = \bar{c}_{\text{recent}} - \bar{c}_{\text{prior}}$$

We look for components where $\Delta_c > 0$. 

#### Deterministic Tie-Breaking:
What if two components show the exact same improvement? (e.g., Range of Motion improved by $+10.0$ pts and Posture/Form Accuracy also improved by $+10.0$ pts).
We must not rely on random dictionary order. We apply a strict **Biomechanical Component Priority**:
1. `rom_score` (Range of Motion / Depth consistency) — The foundational metric.
2. `form_score` (Posture & Form Accuracy) — Spinal safety and posture.
3. `stability_score` (Knee & Torso Stability) — Joint integrity.
4. `smooth_score` (Jerk & Trajectory Smoothness) — Neuromuscular control.
5. `tempo_score` (Cadence & Pacing) — Rep speed control.
6. `completion_quality` (Repetition Completion) — Full return to extension.
7. `symmetry_score` (Bilateral Balance) — Left vs right equilibrium.

If no component improved ($\Delta_c \le 0$ for all components), the engine outputs:
`"Consistent Baseline Performance Across All Components"`

---

### C. Recurring Form Weakness Detection & Severity Tie-Breaking (Subdivision 3.4)

A lifter might make different mistakes across a week. Phase 3 aggregates all violation occurrences from `PoseMetric.violations` across all reps in the reporting window.

1. **Count & Percentage**:
   For each distinct violation $v$:
   $$P_v = \text{round}\left(\frac{\text{count}(v)}{\sum \text{all violations}} \times 100, 1\right)$$
2. **Deterministic Severity Tie-Breaking**:
   If a lifter has 3 counts of `INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH` and 3 counts of `EXCESSIVE_TORSO_LEAN`, which one is flagged as the primary recurring issue?
   The engine uses a deterministic **Biomechanical Risk Hierarchy**:
   1. `INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH` (High Severity — depth failure / invalid work done)
   2. `EXCESSIVE_TORSO_LEAN` (High Severity — lumbar spine shear stress)
   3. `KNEE_ALIGNMENT_ISSUE` (Moderate Severity — knee cave / dynamic valgus)
   4. Alphabetical tie-breaking for custom/future movement violations.
3. **Clean Movement State**:
   If 0 violations were recorded across all reps, the engine returns:
   `"None — Clean Movement Form"`

---

### D. Next-Week Coaching Focus (Subdivision 3.5)

To provide actionable value, the service converts the detected primary weakness and performance trend into a concrete training cue:
- If primary issue is `INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH`:
  > *"Prioritize reaching parallel depth (knee angle <= 90 deg) before commencing upward ascent."*
- If primary issue is `EXCESSIVE_TORSO_LEAN`:
  > *"Maintain an upright chest and brace your core to avoid excessive forward torso lean."*
- If primary issue is `KNEE_ALIGNMENT_ISSUE`:
  > *"Track knees outward in line with your toes to eliminate medial valgus collapse."*
- If no specific form violation, but the overall trend is `declining`:
  > *"Reduce rep speed and focus on controlled eccentric tempo to rebuild movement stability."*
- If movement is clean and trend is `improving` or `stable`:
  > *"Maintain excellent technique and progressively increase repetition volume."*

---

## 5. How Phase 2 Half-Squat Protection Feeds Phase 3 Intelligence

In Phase 2.3 and 2.4, Developer 1 identified that shallow squats ("half-squats") must not count as valid completed reps. 
Phase 2 resolved this by requiring a rep to reach the bottom reversal threshold ($\le 100^\circ$ knee flexion) before allowing state transition to `ASCENDING`. Furthermore, if the user turns around between $100^\circ$ and $115^\circ$, the form analyzer flags `INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH`.

**How this flows into Phase 3:**
1. A shallow attempt will either:
   - Fail to complete (FSM remains in `DESCENDING`), producing zero rep count.
   - Or reach borderline depth and be tagged with `INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH` in `PoseMetric.violations`.
2. Phase 3 aggregates all these tags. If an athlete continually performs borderline shallow reps, Phase 3 immediately identifies `INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH` as the **Recurring Form Weakness** (due to its high severity priority).
3. The coaching engine immediately prescribes: *"Prioritize reaching parallel depth (knee angle <= 90 deg) before commencing upward ascent."*
4. In the frontend reports page, the form violation frequency bar displays the exact percentage of reps that failed depth, creating complete accountability.

## 6. Authentication & Strict Cross-User Data Isolation

Because fitness data is private, strict multi-tenant isolation is enforced at every layer:

1. **Authentication Guard**:
   `GET /performance/weekly` specifies `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)`. Unauthenticated requests immediately receive `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`.
2. **Database Query Scoping**:
   All database queries inside `PerformanceService` explicitly filter on `WorkoutSession.user_id == user_id`:
   ```python
   sessions = (
       db.execute(
           select(WorkoutSession)
           .where(
               WorkoutSession.user_id == user_id,
               WorkoutSession.started_at >= cutoff,
           )
           .order_by(WorkoutSession.started_at.asc())
       )
       .scalars()
       .all()
   )
   ```
3. **Cross-Tenant Verification in Test Suite**:
   In `test_phase_3_performance.py`, `TestPhase3WeeklyAPI` creates two distinct test users: `User A` and `User B`. 
   When `User B` queries `/performance/weekly`, the API verifies that `User B`'s response contains `0` sessions and that none of `User A`'s sessions, scores, or pose violations appear in `User B`'s report.

## 8. Deep-Dive: Explanation of All 10 Phase 3 Tests

The test suite in [`backend/test_phase_3_performance.py`](file:///C:/Users/durganaik/AI-Gym-Fitness-Assistant/backend/test_phase_3_performance.py) verifies every logical branch:

1. **`test_01_empty_history`**:
   - Queries a user with zero workout sessions.
   - Verifies that `total_sessions = 0`, `total_reps = 0`, `average_score = None`, `trend = "insufficient_history"`, and recurring issue is `"None — Clean Movement Form"`.
2. **`test_02_single_session_insufficient_history`**:
   - Verifies that when only 1 session exists, the engine returns `"Baseline session established"` instead of calculating a false trend or false improvement delta.
3. **`test_03_trend_calculations`**:
   - Unit tests mathematical thresholds: verifies that $+15.0$ delta triggers `improving`, $-15.0$ delta triggers `declining`, and $+0.5$ delta triggers `stable`.
4. **`test_04_strongest_improvement_and_tie_breaking`**:
   - Tests three distinct cases:
     - Case A: ROM clearly wins (+20.0 pts vs +2.0 pts).
     - Case B: Exact tie (+10.0 pts for Form and +10.0 pts for ROM). Verifies that `form_score` wins via priority order.
     - Case C: Negative/zero deltas. Verifies fallback message `"Consistent Baseline Performance Across All Components"`.
5. **`test_05_recurring_form_issues_and_tie_breaking`**:
   - Tests violation aggregation: verifies single issue identification, percentage calculation, and severity tie-breaking (when depth and torso lean tie at 1 count, depth wins due to higher severity).
6. **`test_06_unauthenticated_request_rejected`**:
   - Sends `GET /performance/weekly` without an `Authorization` header and verifies that FastAPI returns `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`.
7. **`test_07_weekly_api_lifecycle_and_aggregation`**:
   - Creates two live workout sessions in the database with different dates, exercises, and pose metrics. Queries `GET /performance/weekly?days=7`. Verifies full aggregation, response structure, and cleans up records.
8. **`test_08_empty_history_api`**:
   - Authenticated API request for an existing user who has not logged workouts. Verifies `HTTP 200` with clean default values (no server crash or 500 error).
9. **`test_09_multiple_exercises_aggregation`**:
   - Creates sessions containing multiple distinct exercises (Squat and Push-up). Verifies that `exercise_stats` accurately breaks down volume and averages per exercise name.
10. **`test_10_declining_trend_api`**:
    - Creates a high-scoring session followed by a low-scoring session ($\Delta = -22.0$). Verifies that the API responds with `trend = "declining"` and `score_delta <= -2.5`.

# PHASE 4 PROPOSAL ONLY — ADVANCED EXERCISE EXPANSION & MULTI-EXERCISE VISION INTELLIGENCE

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SCOPE NOTICE**: This is a design and architectural proposal only. Per project rules, **no code has been modified or implemented for Phase 4**. Implementation will commence only after explicit review and approval by Developer 1.

---

## 1. Objectives of Phase 4
Phase 2 and Phase 3 established a world-class single-exercise computer vision and intelligence pipeline centered on the **Squat**. 

The goal of **Phase 4** is to expand the AI Gym from a single-exercise proof-of-concept into a **comprehensive multi-exercise fitness assistant**, adding:
1. **Push-up Pipeline**: Horizontal chest pressing, elbow flexion/extension angles, back sag / hip pike detection.
2. **Bicep Curl Pipeline**: Standing arm isolation, elbow flexion, shoulder swinging / momentum detection.
3. **Dynamic Exercise Switcher & Factory Pattern**: Extensible architecture where new exercises can be registered without modifying core vision loop code.
4. **Multi-Exercise Workout Session Support**: Recording workouts containing multiple exercise sets in a single session.
5. **Unified Multi-Exercise Form Scoring & Feedback**: Tailored biomechanical deduction rules for each exercise.

## 3. Proposed Internal Subdivisions

- **Subdivision 4.1 — Base Exercise Engine & Factory Architecture**:
  Define `BaseExerciseEngine` ABC with standard interface: `process_frame(landmarks) -> MovementResult`. Refactor Squat into `SquatExerciseEngine` while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.
- **Subdivision 4.2 — Push-up Biomechanical Pipeline**:
  Calculate left/right elbow flexion angle (Shoulder $\to$ Elbow $\to$ Wrist). Implement 4-state Push-up FSM (`UP`, `DESCENDING`, `BOTTOM`, `ASCENDING`). Detect hip sag (lumbar hyperextension) and hip pike.
- **Subdivision 4.3 — Bicep Curl Biomechanical Pipeline**:
  Calculate elbow flexion. Implement 4-state Curl FSM. Detect shoulder cheat/swing (elbow displacement relative to ribcage) and incomplete extension.
- **Subdivision 4.4 — Multi-Exercise Visualizer Integration**:
  Adapt canvas overlay to dynamically render active joint angles and skeleton lines specific to the selected exercise.
- **Subdivision 4.5 — Backend & Database Multi-Exercise Workout Session Integration**:
  Enable a single `WorkoutSession` to contain multiple `WorkoutExercise` entries with distinct exercise IDs and per-rep `PoseMetric` entries.
- **Subdivision 4.6 — Frontend Exercise Selector & Multi-Exercise UI**:
  Add exercise picker dropdown in `/workout` (Squat, Push-up, Bicep Curl) and update live camera HUD with exercise-specific metrics.
- **Subdivision 4.7 — Comprehensive Multi-Exercise Test Suite & Regression**:
  Automated tests for Push-up and Bicep Curl state machines, form rules, factory dispatching, and complete regression.
