# Phase 6 — Fitness Habit Tracker & Behavioral AI
## Master Implementation & Architecture Guide

---

### Executive Overview

Phase 6 introduces the **Fitness Habit Tracker & Behavioral AI**, transforming historical workout data into actionable behavioral intelligence. Unlike simple streak counters, this module extracts an 8-dimensional behavioral feature vector from actual user sessions, trains a scikit-learn `LogisticRegression` model with temporal time-series split validation, predicts the probability of a user skipping their upcoming workout window, delivers grounded non-causal factor attributions, provides adaptive habit nudges, and recommends historically consistent workout schedule windows based on past completion frequency.

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Deterministic Feature Engineering Layer (`HabitFeatureEngine`)**:
   Extracts 8 distinct behavioral features strictly from database records (`WorkoutSession` and `User` models) while enforcing temporal cutoff boundaries (`as_of_date`) to guarantee zero future data leakage.

2. **Strict Temporal Training Leakage Enforcement**:
   When constructing training samples across historical sliding 7-day observation windows $T_i$, every target observation window $[T_i+1, T_i+7]$ MUST strictly satisfy `target_end <= evaluation_cutoff`. The model is never trained on any sample whose target window extends beyond the evaluation timestamp.

3. **Disambiguation: Cold-Start vs ML Dataset Requirements**:
   - **Condition A (User Behavioral History):** Users with $< 3$ completed workout sessions return `status: "insufficient_data"`, `skip_probability: null`, `risk_level: "insufficient_data"`, and `model_info: {"model": "None (Cold Start)", "ml_trained": False}`.
   - **Condition B (ML Labeled Sample Size & Class Variance):** Users with $\ge 3$ sessions receive an active prediction (`status: "active_prediction"`). When labeled historical samples are sparse ($N < 6$) or lack class variance (single class), the system uses the `SparseDataFallbackModel` and explicitly sets `"ml_trained": False` in `model_info`. When $N \ge 6$ with positive and negative target variance, `scikit-learn` `LogisticRegression` fits and sets `"ml_trained": True`.

4. **Non-Causal Behavioral Factor Attribution**:
   Provides clear behavioral signal explanations (e.g., *"4 days elapsed since last session (signal associated with higher skip risk)"*) using non-causal language that educates without making diagnostic health claims.

5. **Actionable Adaptive Nudges & Evidence-Based Observational Schedule Intelligence**:
   Generates targeted, non-medical habit nudges based on risk tier (`low`, `moderate`, `high`) and displays historically frequent session times (e.g., *"Historically Most Frequent Session Time: Mondays at 08:00 AM"*) avoiding absolute claims of future optimality.

6. **Database Persistence (`HabitPrediction`)**:
   Stores all prediction telemetry snapshots linked to `users.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` support.

7. **FastAPI Endpoints Scoped to Authenticated User**:
   - `GET /habit/status`: Returns current habit intelligence snapshot.
   - `GET /habit/history`: Returns historical telemetry log.

### The 8 Behavioral Features

1. **`days_since_last_workout`** (`int`): Days elapsed since most recent completed session.
2. **`workout_frequency_7d`** (`int`): Count of completed sessions in past 7 days.
3. **`workout_frequency_30d`** (`int`): Count of completed sessions in past 30 days.
4. **`avg_weekly_workouts`** (`float`): Average weekly sessions across overall user history.
5. **`consistency_score`** (`float`): Ratio of active calendar weeks to total registered weeks `[0.0, 1.0]`.
6. **`preferred_weekday_ratio`** (`float`): Ratio of sessions occurring on user's most frequent weekday.
7. **`max_gap_days_30d`** (`int`): Longest consecutive gap in days between sessions in past 30 days.
8. **`form_score_trend_delta`** (`float`): Change in average posture/form score between recent 2 and prior 2 sessions.
